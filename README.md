## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I am wholly aware of the direction I want to go in terms of functionality. This will come in handy when setting up the core application structure and styling of the application.

### Weaknesses:

I am not completely comfortable with Linking and/or Routing pages. Therefore, I have identified various resources that can be referenced as guidance in case I need support.

### Opportunities:

This project will allow me the opportunity to strengthen my working knowledge of React. Similarly, this project will allow me to further push my abilities with creating an app with attractive styling and usability.

### Threats:

Although I have a clear vision of what needs to be done, it will be vital to monitor the designated timeframes for each task. This will ensure the project stays on track for completion, and allow time to ask for assistance if needed.
